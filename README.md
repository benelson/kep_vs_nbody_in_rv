# A tutorial on modeling Keplerian and n-body orbits in radial velocity data.


Dependencies
=======

Besides a standard Python installation with numpy, matplotlib, etc., you will also need...

-[radvel](http://radvel.readthedocs.io), for modeling Keplerian orbits

-[rebound](http://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for modeling n-body orbits

At the moment, radvel is only compatible with Python2 environments.
